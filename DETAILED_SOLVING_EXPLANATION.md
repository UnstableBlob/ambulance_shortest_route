## üîÑ Eulerian Analysis - Complete Solving Process

### **Step 1: Check Graph Connectivity**

**What we do:**
- Use Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph
- Start from the first vertex and visit all reachable vertices
- Count how many connected components exist

**How it works:**
```javascript
function dfs(start_vertex) {
  visited = {start_vertex}
  stack = [start_vertex]
  
  while (stack is not empty) {
    current = stack.pop()
    for each neighbor of current:
      if (neighbor not in visited) {
        visited.add(neighbor)
        stack.push(neighbor)
      }
  }
}
```

**Why we check this:**
- Eulerian paths/circuits REQUIRE connectivity
- If the graph is disconnected, it's impossible to traverse all edges in one continuous path
- Disconnected graphs have multiple components that can't be reached from each other

**Example:**
```
Graph: A---B    C---D
Connected components: 2
Result: DISCONNECTED ‚Üí No Eulerian path possible
```

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Vertex Degrees**

**What we do:**
- For each vertex, count how many edges are connected to it
- This is called the "degree" of the vertex
- In an undirected graph, each edge contributes to the degree of both endpoints

**How it works:**
```javascript
degrees = {}
for each vertex v:
  degrees[v] = 0

for each edge (u, v):
  degrees[u] = degrees[u] + 1
  degrees[v] = degrees[v] + 1
```

**Example:**
```
Graph: A---B---C
       |   |
       D---E

Vertex A: connected to B, D ‚Üí degree = 2
Vertex B: connected to A, C, E ‚Üí degree = 3
Vertex C: connected to B ‚Üí degree = 1
Vertex D: connected to A, E ‚Üí degree = 2
Vertex E: connected to B, D ‚Üí degree = 2

Result: {A:2, B:3, C:1, D:2, E:2}
```

---

### **Step 3: Identify Odd-Degree Vertices**

**What we do:**
- Go through all vertex degrees
- Separate them into "even" (divisible by 2) and "odd" (not divisible by 2)
- Count how many vertices have odd degree

**Why this matters:**
- This is the KEY to Euler's Theorem
- Even-degree vertices: you can enter and exit the same number of times
- Odd-degree vertices: you have an "unbalanced" entry/exit count

**Mathematical reasoning:**
```
For any vertex v in an Eulerian path:
- If v is in the MIDDLE of the path:
  * Every time you enter v, you must also exit v
  * This uses 2 edges each visit
  * Therefore, deg(v) must be EVEN

- If v is the START or END of the path:
  * You either enter without exiting, or exit without entering
  * This uses 1 edge
  * Therefore, deg(v) must be ODD
  
Conclusion: 
- At most 2 vertices can have odd degree (start and end)
- All other vertices must have even degree
```

**Example from above:**
```
Odd-degree vertices: B (degree 3), C (degree 1)
Odd count: 2
```

---

### **Step 4: Apply Euler's Theorem**

**Theorem (Leonhard Euler, 1736):**

> A connected graph has:
> - **Eulerian Circuit** ‚ü∫ ALL vertices have EVEN degree
> - **Eulerian Path** ‚ü∫ Exactly 0 OR 2 vertices have ODD degree

**Case Analysis:**

#### **Case 1: All vertices have even degree**
```
Odd degree count = 0
Result: 
  ‚úì Eulerian Circuit EXISTS
  ‚úì Eulerian Path EXISTS (circuit is also a path)
  
Explanation:
- Can start at any vertex
- Traverse all edges exactly once
- Return to starting vertex
```

#### **Case 2: Exactly 2 vertices have odd degree**
```
Odd degree count = 2
Let the odd vertices be u and v
Result:
  ‚úó Eulerian Circuit DOES NOT exist
  ‚úì Eulerian Path EXISTS
  
Explanation:
- MUST start at vertex u
- Traverse all edges exactly once
- MUST end at vertex v
- Cannot return to starting point (u ‚â† v)
```

#### **Case 3: Any other number of odd vertices**
```
Odd degree count ‚â† 0 and ‚â† 2
Result:
  ‚úó Eulerian Circuit DOES NOT exist
  ‚úó Eulerian Path DOES NOT exist
  
Explanation:
- Too many "unbalanced" vertices
- Cannot construct a path that uses all edges
```

**Complete Example:**
```
Graph: A---B---C
       |   |
       D---E

Step 1: Check connectivity
  ‚úì Graph is connected

Step 2: Calculate degrees
  A: 2, B: 3, C: 1, D: 2, E: 2

Step 3: Find odd-degree vertices
  Odd vertices: B (deg=3), C (deg=1)
  Odd count: 2

Step 4: Apply Euler's Theorem
  Odd count = 2 ‚Üí Eulerian PATH exists
  Path must be: C ‚Üí B ‚Üí ... ‚Üí (traverse all) ‚Üí ... ‚Üí B
  (Start at C, end at B, or vice versa)

Final Result:
  ‚úì Eulerian Path EXISTS (start at C or B, end at the other)
  ‚úó Eulerian Circuit DOES NOT EXIST
```

## üîÅ Hamiltonian Analysis - Complete Solving Process

### **Fundamental Difference from Eulerian**

**Eulerian:** Visit every EDGE exactly once  
**Hamiltonian:** Visit every VERTEX exactly once

**Complexity:**
- Eulerian: Polynomial time O(V + E) - EASY to check
- Hamiltonian: NP-complete - NO known efficient algorithm

---

### **Step 1: Check Graph Connectivity**

**What we do:**
- Same DFS algorithm as Eulerian analysis
- Verify all vertices are in ONE connected component

**Why we check this:**
- Hamiltonian path MUST visit ALL vertices
- If graph is disconnected, impossible to reach all vertices in one path

**Example:**
```
Graph: A---B    C---D
Components: 2
Result: DISCONNECTED ‚Üí No Hamiltonian path possible
```

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Vertex Degrees**

**What we do:**
- Same degree calculation as Eulerian analysis
- Count edges incident to each vertex

**Why we need this:**
- Used in Dirac's Theorem (check if deg(v) ‚â• n/2)
- Used in Ore's Theorem (check if deg(u) + deg(v) ‚â• n)
- Higher degrees ‚Üí more "connections" ‚Üí better chance of Hamiltonian path

**Example:**
```
Graph with 4 vertices: A---B---C---D---A
Degrees: {A: 2, B: 2, C: 2, D: 2}
n = 4, n/2 = 2
All vertices have degree ‚â• n/2 ‚úì
```

---

### **Step 3: Check Dirac's Theorem (Sufficient Condition)**

**Theorem (Gabriel Andrew Dirac, 1952):**

> If G is a simple connected graph with n ‚â• 3 vertices, and **every vertex has degree ‚â• n/2**, then G has a Hamiltonian circuit.

**Complete Checking Process:**

```
Given: Graph with n vertices, degrees = {deg[v‚ÇÅ], deg[v‚ÇÇ], ..., deg[v‚Çô]}

1. Calculate n/2
   Example: n = 6 ‚Üí n/2 = 3

2. Find minimum degree
   min_degree = min(deg[v] for all v)
   Example: degrees = {3, 4, 3, 5, 3, 4} ‚Üí min = 3

3. Check condition
   IF min_degree ‚â• n/2:
      Result: ‚úì Dirac's condition SATISFIED
      Conclusion: Hamiltonian Circuit GUARANTEED
   ELSE:
      Result: ‚úó Dirac's condition NOT satisfied
      Conclusion: Cannot conclude (try other methods)
```

**Why it works (Intuition):**
- If every vertex has degree ‚â• n/2, the graph is "highly connected"
- From any vertex, you can reach at least half of all other vertices
- This ensures there's always a "way forward" when constructing a path
- Formal proof uses contradiction and path extension techniques

**Example 1: Dirac's condition MET**
```
Complete graph K‚ÇÑ (all vertices connected to all others)
n = 4, n/2 = 2
Degrees: {3, 3, 3, 3}
min(deg) = 3 ‚â• 2 ‚úì

Conclusion: Hamiltonian Circuit GUARANTEED
Sample circuit: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D ‚Üí A
```

**Example 2: Dirac's condition NOT met**
```
Path graph: A---B---C---D
n = 4, n/2 = 2
Degrees: {1, 2, 2, 1}
min(deg) = 1 < 2 ‚úó

Conclusion: Cannot determine from Dirac's theorem
(But this graph DOES have a Hamiltonian path: A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíD)
```

---

### **Step 4: Check Ore's Theorem (Alternative Sufficient Condition)**

**Theorem (√òystein Ore, 1960):**

> If G is a simple connected graph with n ‚â• 3 vertices, and for **every pair of non-adjacent vertices u and v**, deg(u) + deg(v) ‚â• n, then G has a Hamiltonian circuit.

**Complete Checking Process:**

```
Given: Graph with n vertices, adjacency information, degrees

1. For each pair of vertices (u, v):
   a. Check if u and v are adjacent (connected by an edge)
   
   b. If NOT adjacent:
      - Calculate: sum = deg(u) + deg(v)
      - Check: sum ‚â• n?
      - If sum < n: VIOLATION FOUND ‚Üí Ore's condition NOT satisfied
      
   c. If adjacent:
      - Skip (Ore's theorem only checks non-adjacent pairs)

2. If NO violations found:
   Result: ‚úì Ore's condition SATISFIED
   Conclusion: Hamiltonian Circuit GUARANTEED

3. If ANY violation found:
   Result: ‚úó Ore's condition NOT satisfied
   Conclusion: Cannot conclude (try other methods)
```

**Why it works (Intuition):**
- Generalizes Dirac's theorem
- If deg(v) ‚â• n/2 for all v, then deg(u) + deg(v) ‚â• n for any u, v
- Even if some vertices have low degree, compensated by high-degree neighbors
- Ensures "closure" property needed for Hamiltonian circuits

**Example 1: Ore's condition MET**
```
Graph: A---B---C
       |\ /|\ /|
       | X | X |
       |/ \|/ \|
       D---E---F

n = 6
Non-adjacent pairs:
- (A, C): deg(A)=3, deg(C)=3, sum=6 ‚â• 6 ‚úì
- (A, E): deg(A)=3, deg(E)=4, sum=7 ‚â• 6 ‚úì
- (A, F): deg(A)=3, deg(F)=3, sum=6 ‚â• 6 ‚úì
... (all pairs check out)

Conclusion: Hamiltonian Circuit GUARANTEED
```

**Example 2: Ore's condition NOT met**
```
Graph: A---B---C---D
       |           |
       E-----------F

n = 6, need sum ‚â• 6
Non-adjacent pair (B, D):
deg(B) = 1, deg(D) = 1
sum = 1 + 1 = 2 < 6 ‚úó

Conclusion: Cannot determine from Ore's theorem
```

### **Step 5: Exhaustive Backtracking Search (Small Graphs Only)**

**When we use this:**
- Graph has ‚â§ 8 vertices
- Neither Dirac's nor Ore's condition is satisfied
- Want DEFINITIVE answer

**Algorithm: Depth-First Search with Backtracking**

```
function findHamiltonianPath(vertices, adjacency):
  path = []
  visited = set()
  
  function backtrack(current_vertex):
    path.append(current_vertex)
    visited.add(current_vertex)
    
    // Base case: visited all vertices
    if length(path) == n:
      return True  // SUCCESS!
    
    // Recursive case: try all neighbors
    for each neighbor of current_vertex:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        if backtrack(neighbor):
          return True  // Found complete path
    
    // Backtrack: dead end, undo
    path.remove(current_vertex)
    visited.remove(current_vertex)
    return False
  
  // Try starting from each vertex
  for each starting_vertex:
    if backtrack(starting_vertex):
      return path
  
  return None  // No path found
```

**Step-by-Step Example:**

```
Graph: A---B---C
       |       |
       D-------E

Finding Hamiltonian Path:

Try starting from A:
  Path: [A]
  Visit B: Path: [A, B]
  Visit C: Path: [A, B, C]
  Visit E: Path: [A, B, C, E]
  Visit D: Path: [A, B, C, E, D] ‚úì
  
  SUCCESS! All 5 vertices visited
  Hamiltonian Path: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí E ‚Üí D

Check for Hamiltonian Circuit:
  From D, can we return to A?
  D is connected to: A, E
  A is in the path, can return!
  
  Hamiltonian Circuit: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí E ‚Üí D ‚Üí A ‚úì
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
```
Worst case: Try all permutations of vertices
Time complexity: O(n!)

For n = 8: 8! = 40,320 paths to check (feasible)
For n = 10: 10! = 3,628,800 paths (slow but possible)
For n = 15: 15! = 1,307,674,368,000 paths (INFEASIBLE)
```

---

### **Step 6: NP-Completeness Limitation (Large Graphs)**

**When we encounter this:**
- Graph has > 8 vertices
- Neither Dirac's nor Ore's condition is satisfied
- Exhaustive search is computationally infeasible

**What we report:**
```
Result: UNKNOWN
Certainty: Cannot be determined

Explanation:
- Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete (Karp, 1972)
- No known polynomial-time algorithm exists
- Exhaustive search requires O(n!) time
- For n > 8, this is impractical

Suggestion:
- Reduce graph size to ‚â§8 vertices for exact answer
- Add more edges to satisfy Dirac's condition (all deg ‚â• n/2)
- Accept that we cannot determine the answer efficiently
```

**Why this is important academically:**
- Demonstrates understanding of computational complexity
- Shows responsible handling of NP-complete problems
- Educates users about P vs NP distinction
