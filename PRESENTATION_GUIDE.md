### **Topic 2: Eulerian Paths and Circuits** ‚≠ê

#### Euler's Theorem (1736)
**Historical**: Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem

**Mathematical Statement**:

- **Eulerian Path**: Exactly 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree

**In the Application**:
1. Degree table shows each vertex's degree
2. Odd-degree vertices highlighted in red
3. Even-degree vertices highlighted in green
4. Mathematical proof displayed
5. Path start/end points identified

**Complexity**: O(V + E) - polynomial time, in P

### **Topic 3: Hamiltonian Paths and Circuits** ‚≠ê

#### Theoretical Foundation
- **NP-Complete** (Karp, 1972)
- No polynomial-time algorithm known
- One of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems

#### Sufficient Conditions

**Dirac's Theorem (1952)**:
```
If n ‚â• 3 and deg(v) ‚â• n/2 for all v
Then G has a Hamiltonian circuit
```

**Ore's Theorem (1960)**:
```
If n ‚â• 3 and deg(u) + deg(v) ‚â• n for all non-adjacent u, v
Then G has a Hamiltonian circuit
```

**In the Application**:
1. Automatically checks both sufficient conditions
2. Shows which vertices satisfy Dirac's condition
3. Verifies Ore's condition for non-adjacent pairs
4. For small graphs (‚â§8 vertices): runs exact backtracking search
5. For large graphs (>8 vertices): explains NP-completeness, shows only sufficient conditions

**Complexity**: 
- Condition checking: O(V¬≤)
- Exact solution: O(V!) - only feasible for small graphs

### **Topic 4: Graph Connectivity**

#### Connected Components
- **Algorithm**: Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Purpose**: Required for Eulerian analysis

**In the Application**:
- Shows number of connected components
- Displays "Connected" or "Disconnected" status
- Integrated into Eulerian analysis

## üí° Potential Professor Questions & Answers

### Q: "Why is Hamiltonian NP-complete but Eulerian is polynomial?"

**A**: Eulerian paths only need to check degree parity (even/odd) which can be computed in linear time O(E). Hamiltonian paths require checking all possible vertex orderings, which is factorial in nature O(V!), with no known polynomial algorithm.

### Q: "What happens for large graphs with Hamiltonian analysis?"

**A**: For graphs with more than 8 vertices, we only check sufficient conditions (Dirac's and Ore's theorems). We don't run exhaustive search due to factorial time complexity. We explain this limitation to the user with proper academic context about NP-completeness.

### Q: "How do you handle disconnected graphs?"

**A**: For Eulerian analysis, we first check connectivity using DFS. A disconnected graph cannot have an Eulerian circuit or path (by definition, must traverse all edges). For Hamiltonian, we still check sufficient conditions but note that they apply to connected graphs.

### Q: "Are your theorems correctly stated?"

**A**: Yes, all theorems are cited with:
- Proper attribution (author, year)
- Formal mathematical conditions
- Necessary and sufficient distinctions clear
- Edge cases handled (n ‚â• 3 for Hamiltonian)

### Q: "Show me the code implementation"

**A**: Point to:
- `app/utils/graphTheoryAnalysis.js` - Core algorithms (~450 lines)
- `app/components/GraphTheoryAnalysis.jsx` - Display component (~400 lines)
- Clean, well-commented code with clear algorithmic steps
